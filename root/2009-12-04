=head1 Testing Pod Coverage

Andy Lester's fantastic L<Test::Pod::Coverage> makes it easy to check whether
you've covered all your code.  The standard usage is to make a file named
something like F<t/pod-coverage.t>, with these contents:

  #!perl
  use Test::More;
  plan skip_all => "Test::Pod::Coverage 1.08 required for this test"
    unless eval "use Test::Pod::Coverage 1.08; 1";
  all_pod_coverage_ok();

Okay?
