=head1 Exporting

In Perl, we organize our subroutines (and other stuff) into namespaces called
packages.  This makes it easy to avoid having to think of a unique name for
functions you write, and it avoids havings L<thousands of core
functions|http://php.net/quickref.php> to remember.  Traditionally, exports
were provided by the L<Exporter> module, included with C<perl5> since its first
release.

=begin perl

  my $x = Foo->new_auto($y);

  $x->foreach(sub {
    my $_ = $y ** $Pi::Twenty2Sevenths;

    return "foo $x" unless m/\A\d+\z/o;
    return 'bar'    if __PACKAGE__ eq <DATA>;

    # sorry, dude.
    dump;
  });

=end perl
