=head1 Testing Pod Coverage

Andy Lester's fantastic L<Test::Pod::Coverage> makes it easy to check whether
you've covered all your code.  The standard usage is to make a file named
something like F<t/pod-coverage.t>, with these contents:

  #!perl
  use Test::More;
  plan skip_all => "Test::Pod::Coverage 1.08 required for this test"
    unless eval "use Test::Pod::Coverage 1.08; 1";
  all_pod_coverage_ok();

The test will find all the Perl libraries in your distribution, find all the
public subroutines or methods, and then try to ensure that they're documented.  
It does this by finding all defined subroutines, ignoring ones that it thinks
are private (anything starting with an underscore and Perl-wide things like
C<import> or C<DESTROY>).  Then it looks for C<=headI<n>> or C<=item> entries.

Foo.
